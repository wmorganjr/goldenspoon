the embed google map has to be loaded externally vs part of the DOM on load. Reasons are performance related. In the _js folder you'll find a file named common.js. The first line is variable that needs to be defined when you move the site to it's permanent resting place. It should work fine as it is, but if you're experiencing problems, change this var.  Javascript can't find things relative to it's dir. So make sure the address is absolute: i.e http://goldenspoonhopkinton.com/_includes/hopkinton_google_map.php
